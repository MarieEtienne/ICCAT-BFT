\verb+admb+ and \verb+iSCAM+ are assumed to be installed, a \verb+PATH+ variable \verb+ADMB_HOME+ exists and contains the path to \verb+admb+ directory. In addition a \verb+PATH+ variable, called \verb+ISCAM+ contains the path to \verb+iscam+ executable.   
\section{R codes produced and how to use them}
All the codes and results described  or used in this report are freely
available on \url{https://github.com/MarieEtienne/ICCAT-BFT}. 

\iscam  has  been  developped  by  Steven  Martell,  is  available  on
\url{https://github.com/smartell/iSCAM} and described in \cite{Martell11}.

Using \iscam  required to write  some several datafiles as  inputs. To
produce an automatic process and in a context of reproducible science,
some \rcode codes  are used to translate a vpa  format file \verb+*.d1*+ in
inputs     file      for     \iscam.     The     main      file     is
\verb+sources/setISCAMFiles.R+  and required  the directory  where the
*.d1 file  is located. It  generates the input  files for \iscam  in a
directory based on the input  directory. With the current organisation
of the on GitHub, the input files are in \verb+ICCAT-BFT/Input/bfte/2012/...+, so
a directory  \verb+bfte/2012/..+ will  be created  in \verb+ICCAT-BFT+
and \iscam can belaunched from this directory.
